        <em>Hey, I am Akhileshwar</em>
        <h3>Engineer, Learner, and Tinkerer</h3>
      </h1>
      <br />
 
      <p>I'm a 22 year old software engineer with a passion for scalable backend systems, distributed datastores, infrastructure design, and the exciting world of GenAI.</p>
      
      <h3>My Journey So Far</h3>
      <p>My experience spans a diverse range of technologies and projects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Architecting robust REST APIs and implementing efficient gRPC and WebSocket solutions</li>
        <li>Developing cutting-edge GenAI features</li>
        <li>Implementing state-of-the-art RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) algorithms</li>
        <li>Creating AI-powered automations by integrating services like Shopify, Notion, and Firebase</li>
        <li>Implementing robust CI/CD pipelines with Pulumi for AWS and Cloud Build for GCP triggered by GitHub actions</li>
        <li>Dabbling in frontend development with React and HTMX</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Currently, I'm expanding my horizons by diving deeper into:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advanced concurrency programming paradigms</li>
        <li>Systems engineering</li>
        <li>Live video streaming</li>
        <li>Core machine learning and deep learning concepts</li>
      </ul>

    
      <p>I'm also an active contributor to open-source project <a href="https://github.com/DiceDB/dice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DiceDB</a>, a drop-in replacement for Redis that offers SQL-based real-time reactivity. My major contributions to DiceDB include implementing JSON as a datatype and adding support for JSONPath operations, similar to Redis. These enhancements significantly expand DiceDB's capabilities in handling complex data structures.
      <br /> I'm always on the lookout for intriguing projects where I can make meaningful contributions.</p>
